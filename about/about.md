I have always been interesting in technology since I was a kid. I first started using a Macintosh LC back in the early 90s when I was 10. I have been fascinated by computer science ever since. I discovered the Internet when it was not so much widespread in 1994 and remained connected since. I finally ended-up studying Computer Science and particularly Distributed Systems.
I am now an IT manager involved in large scale IT solutions building.
