I have just finished to migrate *www.teenycloud.com* to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll").

![Old site]({{ site.url }}/images/old-teenycloud.jpg)
{: .pull-right}

The old (and ugly) site is now gone! The new one is much nicer and also displays better on mobile devices. I haven't been very active on my blog but I nonetheless have a couple of posts I would like to keep. I still need to find a solution to migrate the content. Thanks to Jekyll this should be fairly easy as it is based on mardown, so I don't foresee any particular issues but I just need to find some time to do it ;-)

I keep the old site [here](http://old-blog.teenycloud.com) until I migrate the content.


Hopefully the new layout will help me be more active !
